    "string_4": "Stretching is a way to loosen any tight muscles to prevent any aches and pains and also to prevent injuries. Not to mention the mood boosting benefits it brings as well.",
    "string_5": "- For the first stretch, lay on the floor on your back, gently hold your leg and pull your knee to your chest, hold for 10 seconds and then repeat on the other leg. Do this a few times.",
    "string_6": "- For the second stretch, while standing up reach one arm across your chest and gently pull it with your other arm towards your body, hold for 10-20 seconds then repeat on the other arm. Do this a few times.",
    "string_7": "- And for the final stretch, kneel on the floor and then place one foot in front of you so that it looks like you are lunging forwards, then begin to gently lean forwards so that you feel a nice stretch. Do this for both sides.",
    "string_8": "To go a step further you can combine these stretches with a short morning exercise to boost your mood and energy even more. Something as simple as going for a 10 minute walk or jog can give you some serious health benefits and set a good intention for the rest of the day.",
